# The Theory of Magic - Project Home

## Introduction:
This document will explain what Magic is, why it exists and how it's used.

## What is Magic?
Magic is a form of raw energy which shows itself visually as coloured light based on intent and power. It can be stored in all objects of the same world without the deteriation of potency or charge when it is in storage. Once stored in an object inanimate or otherwise can then be used in the ways set by the law of the world.

## Why does it exist?
In this case Magic exists to help the worlds creator navigate its own subconsiously made world following the phrase 'Paint this white world in colour...'.

## How is it used?
In this world, magic is used actively only by the worlds creator in the form of charging the magic and 'firing' the said charge towards something or somewhere. If it impacts on something then it would work on the Thoery of Magical Impact and Resonance, otherwise it would gradually disperse based on a few known factors and a few unknown ones. (See the 'Magic Usage Process' later on for more detailed information.)

Even though Magic is only used actively by the worlds creator it is still a form of energy, which means that it can be used in storage and to 'show or hide' objects. 

The Magic in this world is also used to formulate activation puzzles as a form of the worlds self defence.
