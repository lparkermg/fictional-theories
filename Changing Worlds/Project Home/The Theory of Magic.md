# The Theory of Magic - Project Home

## Introduction:
This document will explain what Magic is, why it exists and how it's used.

## What is Magic?
Magic is a form of raw energy which shows itself visually as coloured light based on intent and power. It can be stored in all objects of the same world without the deteriation of potency or charge when it is in storage. Once stored in an object inanimate or otherwise can then be used in the ways set by the law of the world. 

Since magic is an energy mathematical formulas can be used to calculate most of the parts from the charge rate, to the Impact and Resonance.

## Why does it exist?
In this case Magic exists to help the worlds creator navigate its own subconsiously made world following the phrase 'Paint this white world in colour...'.

## How is it used?
In this world, magic is used actively only by the worlds creator in the form of charging the magic and 'firing' the said charge towards something or somewhere. If it impacts on something then it would work on the Thoery of Magical Impact and Resonance, otherwise it would gradually disperse based on a few known factors and a few unknown ones. (See the 'Magic Usage Process' later on for more detailed information.)

Even though Magic is only used actively by the worlds creator it is still a form of energy, which means that it can be used in storage and to 'show or hide' objects. 

The Magic in this world is also used to formulate activation puzzles as a form of the worlds self defence, in stopping anyone or anything from accessing its core. 

## Magic Usage Process:
The Magic Usage Process as a whole process is pretty simple it's split into a Y shape with four seperate processes, starting with the Charge, then the said charge is fired and finally depending on if an object is impacted or not then it will fire an impact and potentially a resonance or the charge will just disperse.

### Charge:
The charge part of magic usage is where you focus magic into a physical form ready to fire. The mathematical equation for working out the charge rate is the following ab/(c/2) where a is the magical potency of the world, b is an unknown gradually incrementing variable and c is the maximum charge that the entity can hold without focus destabilisation.

### Fire:
The fire part of magic usage sets in motion the Dispertion part as it uses the charged magic to move in the direction that it is sent. See the Dispertion section below for more detailed information into the dispertion process. 

### Impact and Resonance:
The Impact and Resonance part of magic usage is split into two parts.

The first being Imapct, this is where a charge of magic, fired or otherwise impacts upon an object causing the charge to be absorbed by the object. Until either the charge is completely absorbed, or the object impacted cannot hold any more magic, only then will the second part happen.

This second part is Resonance, this is where the excess magic charge is compressed at the centre of the object and is then forced to expand outwards. This expansion will continue until either the magic charge powering it disperses or it impacts another object starting the Impact process again.

Like the Charge part of the Magic Usage Process the Impact and Resonance have a mathematical equation for working out the how much resonance will be produced and how far it will go. It can be worked out in two parts, the first being a-(b-c) which is the amount absorbed in the imact. Where a is the current charge impacting the object, b is the objects maximum amount of magic it can hold and c is the objects current amount of magic it holds. The second part is a - b is calculates the maximum resonance radius, where a is the current charge imapacting the object and b is the result of the previous equation.
