# Theory of Magical Impact and Resonance

## Introduction:
Within Project Home every object with the exception of a few are initially 'invisible' this is due to the fact that these objects don't have enough magic in them to show themselves. So the entity that had created the world would have to fire a concentrated charge of magic at the object to get it to show (This theory is explained in the more broader 'Theory of Magic').

This document explains the theory and the process of when varying charges of magic impact upon an object.

*Note: Before getting into the main document make sure you have read through the Theory of Magic document to understand the terminology used in this one.*
